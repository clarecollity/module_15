# Module 15 Challenge: AWS and RoboAdvising 

## Background 

In this challange, we created a bot using Amazon Lex and Amazon Lambda with AWS. This bot is intended to advise site visitors on a retirement plan by actively interacting with them and adapting to their responses. It would be perfect on a banking or financial advisor website, as it would help customers and site visitors get reccommendations and questions answered without calling a customer service line or emailing and waiting for a response. 

## The Bot in Action

here are the slots that I created so that the bot knows how to answer

I was having difficulties uploading a video of my bot, so I took multiple screenshots of it responding so it can still be seen in action.



## Summary 

To improve this bot in the future, I would add the ability to have personalized investment reccommendations sent to the user's phone number or email address. I would include this by adding more slots to the four I already have, and they would prompt the user to enter an email or phone number.
